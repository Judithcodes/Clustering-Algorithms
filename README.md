### Implemented Following Clustering Algorithms :

1. Agglomerative Clustering with two cluster merging criterions.
2. Spectral Clustering.
3. Kernel Kmeans Clustering with RBF and polynomial Kernels.

### A detailed report about assumptions made, mean accuracy, results, observations and datasets used can be found in "REPORT.pdf". 


Randomly sampled a subset of data points/instances of relatively smaller size (order of 1000) for experimentation, in case when the the size of original dataset was huge in terms of number of data points.
